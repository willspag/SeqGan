# SeqGan

Work in Progress Tensorflow 2.3 compatible implementation of Sequence GAN - https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05473

SeqGAN.py is the main file, and walks through how to set everything up. 

SeqGAN.py currently has all of the pretraining and setup, but I'm still working on the reinforcement learning training.
